Among those features we want to find those which are the most meaningful to the description of the targets $t_i$. You can think of the targets as expressing for example the probability to develop a particular trait or disease and the features as encoding the expressivity of particular genes. In such a framework the objective would thus mean finding the genes that most influence the particular trait. For this we will implement a Best Subset Selection approach with cross validation. Complete the cell below by implementing the following steps\n",
